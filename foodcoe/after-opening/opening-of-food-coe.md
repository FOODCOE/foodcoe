# Opening of FOOD COE

After 7 months of renovation and procurement of necessary supplies, FOOD COE was finally completed and opened. In terms of the geographical location of FOOD COE in Iran, the city of Rasht was located in a neighborhood and inside an alley. FOOD COE started its activity with seven models of ham sandwiches and faced many problems in the service sector from the beginning of its activity. After the opening of FOOD COE, we noticed many challenges in providing food services. Limited workforce, limited production capacity, limited menu and variety, these issues have limited our customer circle, but that's not all!

It was only the first weeks of FOOD COE's activity in the virtual space that a content was produced and the creative idea of ​​FOOD COE's marketing was raised. This content was highly viewed and attracted a lot of attention. FOOD COE is the first traditional business in Iran that uses the tools of the world of digital currencies in the marketing and advertising sector and shares the profits of sales with customers.

In the second month of activity, after the two Instagram contents went viral, the demand to buy from FOOD COE increased sharply. FOOD COE, due to its inability to provide full service, would close the shop in the middle of the working day and stop selling. The inability to provide services caused customer discouragement and negative publicity. But what is clear in the meantime was the success of FOOD COE's marketing plan. Maximize your social network advertising with the lowest cost, fully targeted in your geographic area.

Welcoming customers active in the field of cryptocurrency and encouraging the development of this idea.

### How did FOOD COE work?

Customers who made purchases from FOOD COE in person had the opportunity to join the customers' club. When buying in person, you can enter your contact number in the customer club panel. In the second step, send a photo of your purchase invoice to our Instagram and receive a tutorial on how to make an ICPswap wallet. Now customers can easily send their wallet address and receive NFT. This different experience than buying a meal generated a lot of word of mouth.

**Bonuses to NFT holders:** When a customer kept FOOD COE's NFTs, he could share a part of FOOD COE's income every month.\
FOOD COE generally stored 10% of the store's financial input in the form of cryptocurrency and distributed it to NFT holders at the end of the month. FOOD COE was the first traditional business in Iran that reported its store accounting in an open source form to the community, and you can review this report in the white paper.

<mark style="color:red;">In between, there were some bad lucks, which was partly due to low experience in the field of feed. Misfortunes such as heavy rains and flooding caused the destruction of the accounting system, and the provision of the system took 14 days and incurred costs in the first place. Lack of experience in equipping and managing current expenses. Lack of labor in the shop, all departments were managed by one labor force (preparation of raw materials, sandwich production, sales, marketing, etc.). The increase in the price of maintaining the shop for the second year of the contract and...</mark>

### FOOD COE was closed

After 90 days of activity, FOOD COE declared its shop closed and stopped providing food services. During the 90 days of activity, the data was stored with details to be analyzed. The results obtained with the help of the marketing plan worked better than expected. The topic made us think of developing the FOOD COE brand, but not as a food service provider, but as a label that will advertise other brands. FOOD COE will be the guest of other brands on a weekly basis, and during that week, customers who buy from FOOD COE can receive different services from that brand.

* Receive a purchase discount&#x20;
* Receive a new NFT (collaborated target brand logo)
* Participate in each campaign, get meals from more places and get more NFTs each time.
