# FOOD COE NFTs

FOOD COE **NFTs** are owned by customer club members. Customer club members are people who buy **sandwiches** from FOOD COE in person. If they wish, they can register the name, contact number, address, **ICPSWAP** destination wallet and receive an NFT from the FOOD COE collection.

### Enthusiasts from all over the world

Thanks to the web3 platform and data security, we can internationally finance any idea and bet on it. \
If the **DAO** approves the **COE** project, there will be an opportunity for participation and financing for few days before the opening of the **FOOD COE**. Interested parties can buy an NFT from the FOOD COE collection from anywhere in the world and benefit from current income as long as the activity of this brand continues.

**Collection of FOOD.COE NFTs with EXT standard on ICPswap platform.**

The first collection of FOOD COE with a maximum number of 10 thousand NFTs was created on the ICPswap platform. Now we can do NFT transactions in the FOOD COE collection with the help of WICP tokens.\
For NFT trading on the ICPswap platform, we need to first convert our ICPs to WICPs in order to trade NFTs. We can do this action easily, it is necessary to first refer to the menu section and then select the WICP option.

**Important advice:** We must note, FOOD COE rewards will be distributed in the form of COE tokens. This happens with the help of claim option in ICPswap. If we operate in the ICPSWAP space with a phone, it is better to keep NFTs in a place where you can connect to ICPSWAP.
