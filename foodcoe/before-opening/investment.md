FOOD COE sandwich shop will generally reward 10% of its **financial** input to customers who join the customer club. These rewards are provided in the form of COE **tokens**.

**How is this possible?** The target business converts 10% of its financial input into ICP at the daily price every 24 hours. At the end of each month, it will spend these saved ICP tokens to buy COE tokens. This purchase of COE tokens is done from BABYAROF/COE trading pair. Purchased COE tokens will be distributed to customer club members at the end of each month.

> We must note that the **FOOD COE** team is committed to complying with this structure as long as it is active as a brand in the traditional market. In-person customers receive monthly gifts if they participate in the customer club and receive **NFTs**, but the gifts should not be considered a debt in any way. Customers can participate, but they cannot legally claim money from FOOD COE.

### International investors

A maximum of 1000 investors can invest in this pilot project. This is a special investment proposal for the COE project community. After 1 year of efforts of the COE team, the first traditional businesses will finally be opened under the strict supervision of the COE team. This small business will study the market in small dimensions, examine the real statistics and have the ability to expand quickly. The first branch of FOOD COE can distribute a minimum of 500 dollars and a maximum of 2000 dollars to the community\
This distribution is done in the form of COE tokens with the support of ICP. They can invest on this wave every month before injecting capital into the community token flow. The growth of BABYAROF/COE trading pair's financial turnover can strongly give COE a bullish outlook. Because in each transaction BABYAROF tokens are definitely burned 1% of the transaction volume.

#### A maximum of one thousand FOOD COE documents

There are 1000 documents of participation in the establishment of FOOD COE, which can be purchased before the opening of the community and receive rewards from FOOD COE's income like in-person customers.\
Cryptocurrency community who are not able to buy in person from FOOD COE can participate in the financing section and share in the **start-up** profits.

#### Offer price per share

The capital required for the establishment and strong development of this business is estimated at a maximum of 460 **ICP**. In the same way, we suggest that the selling price of each share is 0.46 ICP! A maximum of one thousand NFTs from the collection of FOOD COE's customer club will be listed by the team for sale.

### Growing customer club members and reducing rewards

At the same time as the members of the customer club grow, monthly bonuses will be distributed to more members and their volume will decrease.\
Of course, sales will increase in the same way, because the marketing plan and customer club can cause word of mouth advertising. This marketing plan can invite many enthusiastic people to FOOD COE for even one purchase. We must note that the maximum capacity of sandwich production from this small shop is limited. If we approach the average production capacity, more plans will be proposed for the development of this brand.

The ability to produce sandwiches in this small shop is limited to a maximum of 300 sandwiches per day. Therefore, with the growth of customer club members and reaching the **maximum average sales**, the monthly income will gradually decrease. In this regard, a road map has been planned to quickly pave the way for the expansion and opening of more FOOD COE branches in different areas of the city.
