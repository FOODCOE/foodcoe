# Financial output

Since the middle of the third month of its activity, Food Coe has prepared a simple and daily template for reporting the current and daily costs of FOOD COE for the general public. From now on, everyone can view and review the current costs of FOOD COE with a maximum delay of 48 hours.

In the Google sheet below, you can see columns such as the date on a daily basis, the amount of the cost in the currency of the country of origin, and also in the last column the cost in dollar value of the day of the country of origin.
