# Financial input

In the desired Google sheet, you can check the months of FOOD COE activity in different sheets.

**Data such as:**

* The number of sandwiches sold per working day, separated by small and large sandwiches
* Amount of financial input of FOOD COE in units of Rials
* The value of Rial to Dollar amount (Rial to Dollar conversion time)
* ICP price unit at the moment of converting dollars to ICP
* Amount of stored ICPs

At the end of each month, we upload a table that specifies the exact amount of COE purchased and the share of each holder of FOOD COE NFTs.
